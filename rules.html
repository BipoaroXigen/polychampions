      <h1>SERVER RULES</h1>
      <h2>a. General Rules</h2>
<div class="general">
  <ol>
    <li> No use of slurs, racial or sexist or otherwise.</li>

    <li> No linking to other discord servers outside of #off-topic.</li>

    <li> No jumping teams one week after your team has started a season.</li>

    <li> No political or religious debates.</li>

    <li> Use the appropriate channels for discussion.</li>

    <li> No Gore or NSFW/NSFL stuff.</li>

    <li> Don't ping spam, or spam in general. If you ping someone, do not delete it. Ghost pings are not allowed!</li>

    <li> Stay honest, and stay respectful of your opponents. If you bash or make fun of a winning, or losing, player you will receive a pity mute for an hour. (Good natured, competitive team bashing â‰  mean-spirited bashing of individual players.)</li>

    <li> Arguing you did not know the rules does not justify a wrong-doing, both in-game and server wide. Ignorance is no excuse.</li>
  </ol>
  </div>
  <div class="kicking">
   <h2>b. Kicking/Timing out</h2>
 <ol>
    <li> If a player times out from a season game, they should be pinged first in #dont-time-out-you-snowflake and given a 6 hour grace period to take their turn or respond. This grace period is only offered once per game, per team. Subsequent timeouts from players on that team can be kicked after a standard 24 hour time out.
</li>
    <li> A season player can take up to 48 hours to take their turn one time in a season game, provided they notify opponents using the $ping command in #dont-time-out-you-snowflake before their turn expires.</li>

    <li>  Before kicking a timed out player, you must refresh the game and take a screenshot showing that the player has timed out, also showing the game has been refreshed less than 60 seconds ago.</li>
 </ol>
  </div>
  <div class="cheating">

      <h2>c. Cheating</h2>
    <ol>
    <li> If a player or team is judged to be cheating in any games, whether by sabotage, using other teams screenshots, or otherwise, it will result in a permanent ban.</li>

    <li> Game results affected by cheating will be nullified, and the teams cheated against will be awarded an automatic win.</li>

    <li> If a team is proven to cheat in any games, that team will be disbanded, disgraced, their banner and name will be dragged through the dirt in shame. All members of that team will stand trial, and any members found innocent will be allowed to join other teams.</li>

    <li> If someone is discovered to be cheating, and their teammate reports it, that team will avoid taking the forfeit for the cheating.</li>
    </ol>
    <div>
    <p>Cheating includes: turn resetting. Turn reset is forbidden if it's used to gain information that you couldn't have known without it, examples: researching  climbing to get on a mountain for vision and then resetting, choosing explorer when upgrading city and then resetting, claiming ruin to see what it grants and then resetting, and the like.
It is only legitimate for missclicks - like if you choose park instead of giant. Try to keep it as minimal as possible.</p>

      <h1>LEAGUE RULES</h1>
      <div class="league">
      <h2>a. League Games</h2>
      <ol>
    <li>  The League Games are divided into Seasons.</li>

    <li> Seasons' games consists of 18 games, 2v2s and 3v3s, per team separated into 3 games per team per week.</li>

    <li> Seasons' games are created and filled by Team Leaders or Co-Leaders. Games need to be filled more than 24 hours prior to the end of that weeks deadline, generally Sunday, 11:59 pm / 23:59 HST (Hawaii).</li>
    <li> If a team fails to fill a season game, or make a good faith effort to start a game by the weeks deadline, that team will receive a forfeit for the game. The opposing team will be marked as winner.</li>

    <li> Choosing Polaris will force a restart of any League Game, even if discovered after Turn 5. Any mistake or accidental tribe picks (except Polaris) will not justify a reset of the game. You live with the mistake you have, or your team forfeits the match and takes a loss. As of Season 5, Polaris is banned from all season games, but remains legal for ELO and all other games.</li>

    <li>
      <ul id="ab">
    <li><span class="bold">a.</span> Junior league: A league for junior players consist of 9 games for regular season, in 2v2 (Med) game format. Home team is the inverse of senior teams schedule (If Mallards host game against Bombers, Dynamite will host a game against Drakes). The Junior league follows same rules as Senior league does. Junior teams performance in league will affect who gets to host 2 games in Senior league playoffs. The winners get title of Junior Season champion!</li>
    <li><span class="bold">b.</span> Deciding the 3rd game host for Senior league playoffs based on Junior teams performance:</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <ul id="ab">
        <li><span class="bold">A.</span> The team which made it further (Junior season champion>finalist>semi-finalist>none).</li>
        <li><span class="bold">B.</span> The team with more league victories.</li>
        <li><span class="bold">C.</span> Team with more league victories against the competing teams.</li>
        <li><span class="bold">D.</span> Team with more league games (team which failed less participating in scheduled games).</li>
        <li><span class="bold">E.</span> 2v2 Tiny map game with BLP ban.</li></ul>
</li>
    <li> Team promotion and demotion are permitted under these conditions:
      <ul id="ab">
        <li><span class="bold">a.</span> A Pro player demoted to junior can't play season games in the junior season.</li>
        <li><span class="bold">b.</span> A junior player can be promoted to the pro team at any point without consequences.</li>
      </ul></li>
      </ol>
      </div>
      <div class="restart">
        <h2> b Restarts</h2>
      <ol>
    <li>The general rule about restarts is that there are none after turn 5 unless it is discovered a player is using a banned tribe (currently Polaris is banned) or if it can be confirmed that a game-breaking bug is affecting a player or if a kick that was allowed because of a bug (ex: the one that says it's no one's turn).</li>

    <li>We allow restarts for team matches if half of the team (round up) has a restartable spawn (i.e. 1 player for a 2v2 and 2 players in the same team for 3v3, etc). These require approval by an impartial @Mod.</li>

    <li>Restartable spawn: If it is impossible to capture a city by the end of turn 5 without engaging in combat or buying a technology, your spawn is considered restartable. Examples: 1-city island, having to buy climbing to find a second village.</li>

    <li>a Kickoo exception:  If Kickoo starts with a whale within the initial border of their capital, their spawn is not considered to be restartable.</li>
      </ol>
      </div>
      <div class="playoffs">
        <h2>c. Playoffs</h2>
<ol>


  <li><p>The playoffs consist of two rounds:</p>
<p>The Semi-Final Round, two 2v2s between the top four teams, 1st Seed vs 4th Seed, and 2nd Seed vs 3rd Seed.</p>
<p>The Championship Round, a 3v3 between the Semi-Final Winners.</p></li>

    <li>Each Semi-Finals and Final consist of 3 simultaneous matches with different rosters. A member can't be in more than 3 out of the 6 potential matches (since a team winning at least 2 of the 3 matches of the Semi-Finals will play 3 more matches in the Final).
</li>
    <li>The host for the third game is determined by Junior league outcome.
</li>
    <li><ul><p>Playoff Seeding will be based on Season W/L Record, If two or more teams tie, then the following list will be used as a Tie-Breaker Scheme, going down the list until a winner is declared.</p>
        <li><span class="bold">A.</span> Head-to-Head season record</li>
        <li><span class="bold">B.</span> Forfeits</li>
        <li><span class="bold">C.</span> In-Conference W/L Record</li>
        <li><span class="bold">D.</span> Season results vs 1st Seed, then 2nd Seed, then 3rd Seed, and 4th Seed</li>
        <li><span class="bold">E.</span> Lightning Round 2v2 Tiny map, No timing-out, Tie-Breaker game (Only applies to Seeds 1st through 4th)</li>
      </ul></li>
    <li><ul><p>At the end of the season, games that are still active are considered in Overtime. Only games that may affect Seeds 1st through 4th will be allowed to play out, all other games will be immediately decided by the following criteria, going down the list until a winner is declared.</lip>
        <li><span class="bold">A.</span> Whichever team controls the most enemy capitals</li>
        <li><span class="bold">B.</span> Whichever team is producing the most stars</li>
        <li><span class="bold">C.</span> Whichever team owns the most cities total</li>
        <li><span class="bold">D.</span> Whichever has the most points</li>
      </ul></li>
  <li>Any games in Overtime that affect the playoffs will be allowed to finish, with a modified rule: All players that time-out will be insta-kicked, there will be no provision for warning people in #dont-time-out-you-snowflake.
</li>
